                The City of London, widely referred to simply as the City, is a
                city, ceremonial county and local government district that
                contains the ancient centre, and constitutes, alongside Canary
                Wharf, the primary central business district (CBD) of London and
                one of the leading financial centres of the world. It constituted
                most of London from its settlement by the Romans in the 1st
                century AD to the Middle Ages, but the modern area named London
                has since grown far beyond the City of London boundary. The City
                is now only a small part of the metropolis of Greater London,
                though it remains a notable part of central London.
              Administratively, the City of London is not one of the London
              boroughs, a status reserved for the other 32 districts. It is also
              a separate ceremonial county, being an enclave surrounded by
              Greater London, and is the smallest ceremonial county in England.

              village, it was established as a city in January 2021 from the
              former rural community (ayyl aymagy) of Bazar-Korgon (villages
              Bazar-Korgon, Besh-Badam, Jeti-Koshkon and Kök-Alma) and part of

              of its inhabitants are ethnic Uzbek (approximately 80 percent) and
              the remaining 20% are predominantly ethnic Kyrgyzs. The town has a
              large open air market. Shared taxis to the regional capital

            <p class="description">
              In the eastern Arabian Peninsula on the coast of the Persian
              Gulf,[13] it is a major global transport hub for passengers and
              cargo.[14] Oil revenue helped accelerate the development of the
              city, which was already a major mercantile hub. A centre for
              regional and international trade since the early 20th century,
              Dubai's economy relies on revenues from trade, tourism, aviation,
              real estate and financial services.[15][16][17][18] Oil production
              contributed less than 1 percent of the emirate's GDP in 2018.[19]
              The city has a population of around 3.49 million (as of 2021).[20]

              Baku (US: /bɑːˈkuː, ˈbɑːkuː/, UK: /bæˈkuː, ˈbækuː/;[7][8]
              Azerbaijani: Bakı [bɑˈcɯ] ⓘ) is the capital and largest city of
              Azerbaijan, as well as the largest city on the Caspian Sea and in
              the Caucasus region.[9] Baku is 28 metres (92 ft) below sea level,
              which makes it the lowest lying national capital in the world and
              also the largest city in the world below sea level. Baku lies on
              the southern shore of the Absheron Peninsula, on the Bay of Baku.
              Baku's urban population was estimated at two million people as of
              2009.[10] Baku is the primate city of Azerbaijan—it is the sole
              metropolis in the country, and about 25% of all inhabitants of the
              country live in Baku's metropolitan area.
